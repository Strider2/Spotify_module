Spotify 1.0

This module will let you place your spotify playlist you create. It works best if you have spotify premium.

If you have installed my codeshare module all you have to do is import the update_strider.sql file

If not, please import the phpvms_strider and edit the SpotifyData.class.php file on line 64 and change the 2 to a 1.


To use this, you will need to get the playlist code by going into spotify and to the playlist you created and beside where it says play click the 3 dots and go to share, click on spotify URI paste it into a blank text document and copy the code.

EG: spotify:playlist:7rM9A6g9k1aVJGk3Gv4BKI

The last part is the code you need.
